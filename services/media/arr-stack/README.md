# Media Services

This directory contains various media-related services that can be used to manage and stream media content.

## Filebrowser
The original Filebrowser project is deprecated. I replaced it with a fork that has more features and is actively maintained.

## Jellyseerr
For managing media requests and approvals, Jellyseerr is a great tool that integrates well with media servers.
